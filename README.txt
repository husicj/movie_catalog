This project is intended to serve two purposes related to watching movies.
One, as a way to both log what movies you have already watched, rating
them on a number of aspects, as well as logging comments. Second, as a
watchlist for uwatched movies.

Planned features:
 - Movie search using external movie database
 - variety of options for logging movies watched
   + searching watched movies, with filters
   + rating movies (overall rating, rewatchability, aesthetic, etc.)
   + customizable log entries
   + ability to leave comments after watching, with the ability to
     update with further thoughts or after rewatching
 - transfer of movies from watchlist to log
 - searchable watchlist with filters, comments, where first heard of, etc,


This project began as a personal project to keep track of movies I have
watched and been recommended in an organized way, as well as a project to
challenge myself to learn a variety of aspects of programming outside my
previous realm of experience.
